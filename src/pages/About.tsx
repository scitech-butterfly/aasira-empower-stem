    bio: "Hi! I am an AIML undergraduate who's obsessed with exploring all aspects of any new technology she comes across. Having had a keen inclination towards STEM fields since the early stages, I noticed the gender gap right at the onset of middle school. Over the years as I started observing a bias, I felt a rage I couldn't express.  Aasira is an attempt to extend a hand to the community that faces this every day and work towards inclusiona and diversity in STEM fields.",

    bio: "Being a undergraduate student, pursuing Computer Science, I have always felt great affection for technology and its applications. I believe that technology assorted with social good is the key to modernisation and development. When I decided to explore Science, later did I realize the major STEM gender gap- despite decades of progress towards equality, women are still underrepresented in the tech workforce, figures speaking for themselves. Having said that, I am of the opinion that women need to be empowered and get themselves equipped with digital skills to shape the future. Through Aasira, we aim to develop a women-centered atmosphere where we rise and learn together. We focus towards providing wings of courage to women as they prepare their flight towards change-making.",
